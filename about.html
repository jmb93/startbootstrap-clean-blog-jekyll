<p>I'm currently working as a structural engineer for WSP USA. My office mainly focuses on trainsporation and infrastructure, so that's a fancy way of saying we work on the design of rail and highway bridges, as well as other things like catenary systems. </p>

<p> My goal with this website is to learn more about how websites work, what goes into making your own, and taking a first step into learning more about what you can do with the power of a computer.  </p>

<p> Some posts you might find on here include: film reviews, pictures of my miniatures paintings and some topics of interest in engineering. </p>
