<p>I'm currently working as a structural engineering for WSP USA. My office mainly focuses on trainsporation and infrastructure, so that's a fancy way of saying we work on the design of rail and highway bridges, as well as other things like catenary systems. </p>

<p> My goal with this website is to learn more about how websites work and what goes into making my own. </p>
